The Iris Dataset
Introduction
The Iris flower data set or Fisher’s Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by Sir Ronald Fisher (1936) as an example of discriminant analysis Fisher [1936]. Iris is a genus of 260–300 species of flowering plants with showy flowers (see Fig. 2.5). The name stems from the Greek word for a rainbow, as the flower colors have a broad variety. The three species of the data set are Iris setosa (Beachhead Iris), Iris versicolor (Larger Blue Flag, Harlequin Blueflag), and Iris virginica (Virginia Iris). This data set is sometimes called Anderson’s Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species Anderson [1935]. Two of the three species were collected in the Gaspe Peninsula “all from the same pasture, and picked on the same day and measured at the same time by the same person with the same apparatus” Anderson [1935].
Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters(see Fig. 2.6). For each of the three species 50 flowers were measured (see part of the data in Tab. 2.2). Based on these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other.

Relevance to Data Analytics

The Iris dataset is deservedly widely used throughout statistical science, especially for illustrating various problems in statistical graphics, multivariate statistics and machine learning.
•	Containing 150 observations, it is small but not trivial.
•	The task it poses of discriminating between three species of Iris from measurements of their petals and sepals is simple but challenging.
•	The data are real data, but apparently of good quality. In principle and in practice, test datasets could be synthetic and that might be necessary or useful to make a point. Nevertheless, few people object to real data.
•	The data were used by the celebrated British statistician Ronald Fisher in 1936. (Later he was knighted and became Sir Ronald.) At least some teachers like the idea of a dataset with a link to someone so well known within the field. The data were originally published by the statistically-minded botanist Edgar S. Anderson, but that earlier origin does not diminish the association.
•	Using a few famous datasets is one of the traditions we hand down, such as telling each new generation that Student worked for Guinness or that many famous statisticians fell out with each other. That may sound like inertia, but in comparing methods old and new, and in evaluating any method, it is often considered helpful to try them out on known datasets, thus maintaining some continuity in how we assess methods.
•	Last, but not least, the Iris dataset can be enjoyably coupled with pictures of the flowers concerned.
Note. Do your bit for biological correctness in citing the plants concerned carefully. Iris setosa, Iris versicolor and Iris virginica are three species (not varieties, as in some statistical accounts); their binominals should be presented in italic, as here; and Iris as genus name and the other names indicating particular species should begin with upper and lower case respectively.
